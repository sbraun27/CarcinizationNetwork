1. Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies - What, Why, How? 
    1. Blockchain: The blockchain is a distributed and decentralized ledger that stores data such as transactions, and that is publicly shared across all the nodes in its network.
    2. Block: A block stores data (such as transactions), the block's hash, and the last block's hash. 
    3. Distributed: Multiple nodes are connected to the network and get an entire history of the blockchain ledger and any subsequent changes. There isn't one central organization that controls the history of the chain. No one central point of failure. 
    4. Cryptocurrencies are different than a blockchain. Cryptocurrencies have Secure blockchain, wallets, and mining

2. Mining blocks and the genesis block
    1. blocks have 4 attributes: timestamp, last_hash, data, hash

3. Hashing and SHA-256
    1. Secure Hash Algorithm - 256 bits, represents the output in 64 characters in hexadecminal form. 
    2. Produces a unique value for unique input
    3. A one-way function, but easily verified. 

4. Encoding and decoding in UTF-8
    1. Encoding: The proces off converting data into an alternate representation.
    2. Character encoding: Converting strings into bytes (e.g. UTF-8 encoding, 8-bit representation)
        1. An 8 bit byte is referred to as an octet
    3. Decoding: The process of converting encoded data back into its original format
